Here's a DEM discussion that snowballed. Thought you might be interested. Are you guys already tuned into the Geomorphometry discussion group? If so I won't forward any more stuff.

 Subject: [geomorphometry] DEM creation from digitized map
 
Dear all
 
 I was wondering if anyone out there has any experience with 
 preparation of
 DEM from digitized map. By this, I mean if someone digitized 
 a map, how
 could it be possible to convert the resulting file into a DEM 
 file for the
 area under consideration? The original map was a contour map 
 for the area
 
 Thanks
 Abedini

Dear Abedini,

Turning contours into a grid DEM is fairly routine exercise and there
are a number of programs that will do it. I am familiar with ANUDEM
(also available in Arc/Info as the TOPOGRID command), which does a
good job of interpolating between contours and maintaining stream
connectivity. ANUDEM can also make use of directed stream lines to
indicate which way the surface drains which is particularly useful
when contour lines are widely spaced in flat areas. ANUDEM is one of
the products of the Centre for Resource and Environmental Studies,
http://cres.anu.edu.au/outputs/software.html.

I think most GISs can do interpolation from contours. There are many 
algorithms available, but some are better than others. Inverse distance 
weighting is simple and quick but is of lower quality than kriging or 
spline-based methods. Terrain-specific methods (such as ANUDEM) that 
preserve ridge and valley lines and maintain drainage connectivity are
generally better than general purpose interpolation methods.

Regards,

Dear List-Members,

I admit, that I have an axe to grind on this one, but I suggest couple of
references concerning this particular case:

Oksanen, J. & Jaakkola, O. (2000). Interpolation and accuracy of
contour-based raster DEMs. Reports of the Finnish Geodetic Institute 2000:2.
32 p.

Jaakkola, O & Oksanen, J. (2000). Interpolation techniques which save
terrain morphology: Creating DEMs from contour lines. GIM International, 14:
9, 46-49.

From these you'll find comparisons of several contour-based DEM
interpolation techniques and their suitability especially for Finnish
topography (= old shield are carved by the latest glaciation).

This is the most common mistake, that people do when they start the
contour-DEM interpolation. The methods that John listed (eg. IDW or SPLINE)
are CONTOURING techniques for POINT data. But, sparse point data is much
worse descriptor of surface, than the contour lines. For example: a one
contour pair makes a clear restriction of "legal" elevation values between
them, point data does not include any restriction like this. Therefore, the
point interpolation techniques should not be used with contour lines. Of
course it is possible to take sample of points from contours, but then we
throw away a lot of surface specific information, such as aspects and
steepest slopes.

You should also be very careful with spline-based techniques, such as
TOPOGRID (or ANUDEM algorithm), because in certain topography, the
undershoot and overshoot errors might not be acceptable. Steep slope close
to flat terrain is very dangerous... (seven meter undershoot error in one of
our test areas, source data has 2.5 m contour interval!)

Sincerely Yours,

Further to the email exchange below - I have done quite a lot of research
comparing different methods of creating DEMs from contours - the most recent
results were reported in :

Wise S.M. (2000) Assessing the quality for hydrological applications of
digital elevation models derived from contours. Hydrological Processes 14,
1909-1929

I can certainly confirm what John says about the superiority of
ANUDEM/TopoGrid over general purpose methods. Triangulation-based methods
would be good, if you could get a decent triangulation - unfortunately there
are several well known problems with triangulating contours which means that
a good triangulation is difficult to achieve.

I didn't actually use kriging in my tests - I assumed that the results would
be the same as inverse distance weighting, since this is how kriging
actually interpolates - the only difference is that the weights are based on
the input data. However the problems with these approaches when applied to
contours are that most heights are interpolated from points on the two
bounding contours, which results in a 'wedding-cake' like DEM. I assume this
would be the same for kriging - can anyone confirm this?

Cheers

********************************************************************************************
There have been a number of replies to this question on interpolation of
contours to generate a DEM.  I too am part of a team which has been,
and still is, looking at better methods for terrain reconstruction using, in
part, contours.  Of course, there is nothing special about contours, but
they tend to be common.

I think an important point to realise is that there is no ultimate "best DEM"
that you can generate from contours.  The "best DEM" depends on how
you want to use the DEM that's generated.  If you're interested in
maintaining an assumed network of hydrology, then methods such as
ANUDEM probably will give a more acceptable result than, say, TIN. 
Then again, this advantage tends to be more obvious in low-relief
topography (if I am generalising, say Australia) than in topographic
regimes where the hydrology is very strongly constrained by the strong
slopes, as is certainly the case in a lot of areas in New Zealand (for
instance).  Then again, if maintaining the hydrological networks is not
something you absolutely MUST follow, then ANUDEM might not be the
best answer.  For instance, we have shown that ANUDEM gives an
inferior result (expressed in terms of error bias and rms error from an
independent gold standard reference DEM) compared to a DEM
generated when the hydrological constraints are withdrawn and linear
interpolator of our own design is used.  Then again, such a simple linear
terrain interpolation might not be good for some visualisation work since it
introduces visual artifacts.

So, I don't think it's a matter of finding the best technique, it's a matter of
asking really searching questions about what you want to use the DEM
for, what information you can add to the DEM generation problem, and
what constraints in the DEM interpolation process you are prepared to
sacrifice to get the best result, given your constraints.  Unfortunately,
many reviews of interpolation techniques have implicit assumptions
about how these constraints are weighted, and it makes a comparison
between methods difficult, sometimes impossible.

**********************************************************************************************
I've already had one go at this topic, but I hope you can tolerate a 
couple of follow-up comments.

Juha Oksanen's comment about pairs of contour lines specifying a bound
on elevations is a good point, and this should be respected by a good
quality interpolation method. ANUDEM/TOPOGRID does not do this and it
does indeed have problems with overshoot at abrupt changes in slope,
because of the continuity assumptions of the underlying spline model.
Steve Wise's paper shows an example of this. The other thing Steve's
paper illustrates is the problem of biasing towards contour elevations,
which is quite noticeable in ANUDEM/TOPOGRID (but not as bad as some 
other methods). I believe Mike Hutchinson is revising ANUDEM to deal
with that now.

Juha's other point about contour lines containing more information than
just elevation is also worth reinforcing. Contours are not just a 
collection of spot heights, they also directly encode aspect and
plan curvature, and indirectly represent ridge and valley lines.
ANUDEM/TOPOGRID enforces linear interpolation along ridge and valley
lines inferred from contour shape to improve the representation of
those terrain features.

At this stage there isn't (to my knowledge) any perfect method, and
as Stephen McNeill pointed out the best DEM depends on what you want
to do with it. It seems most of the problems have been solved by
different people, so maybe DEM users should be encouraging the
DEM program developers to get together and pool their knowledge and 
experience to overcome the known deficiencies in the existing methods.

**************************************************************************************************
This is an interesting discussion and one that seems to emphasise the useful
role of e-lists. the comment regarding the application of a DEM being
integral in its quality is important.  Those of us who use Synthetic
Aperture Radar have to use DEMs to radiometrically correct our satellite
data. However if you look in the literature then you will see the use of
'50m DEMs' (in itself poor terminology presumably mean a DEM with a 50m
pixel size)...when you have 12.5m pixels in a satellite image then your 50m
DEM will not correct for the topographic effects of a pixel with any degree
of accuracy unless you terrain is regular.  DEM generation is therefore
important.  The use of digitised maps can only muliply potential errors and
the discussion here is a useful highlight of the issues (thanks).  Would any
happen to know of a recent review article? Or oucld someone summarise some
useful papers I could follow up with.
Cheers
Ian

***********************************************************************************************
SAR is one of the few cases I can think of where terrain slope
reconstruction accuracy is probably as important as height accuracy, if
not more so, since the slope affects the bulk radiometry and the
polarisation phase response so much.  Of course, an analagous problem
also arises in the optical BRDF, but the issue is exacerbated in the SAR
case.  The literature is deparately thin on the inter-relationship between
terrain height and slope errors (and errors at higher order) and most
RS/GIS systems are in the dark ages in the algorithms they use for the
estimation of slope.  We're doing some work on slope reconstruction
now, mainly stimulated by our use of multi-polarisation SAR in hilly
terrain, but it's a can of worms.

Hi Folks,

I've been watching the discussion on the generation of DTMs from contours with
interest. When I was a student (of land surveying) the quality guidelines for
contours was plus or minus 0.25 * the interval. I'd be very interested if 
anyone had investigated generation of a "fuzzy" DTM taking this factor into
account.

Regards

Richard

****************************************************************************************************
Thanks for the comment about the accuracy of contours. In my work I have
deliberatley not considered the accuracy of the contours themselves. I have
simply focused on the extent to which the DTM reflects the terrain as
described by the original contours - many interpolation methods produce a
DTM which doesn't agree with the original contours in some cases (e.g.
overshoots in the case of spline based methods). It would be a fairly simple
matter to add in a variation of 25% of the contour interval and see the
effect.

25% seems a huge variation to me - I'm sure that in some cases ths will
translate to an enormous range of possible horizontal positions for a
contour in an area of low slope

DTMs can be smoothed or small amounts of error added to improve surface
representation for specific uses. One example is presented by Peter Burrough
et al. in a paper on landform classification using fuzzy clustering -- Fuzzy
Sets and Systems (2000) 113:37-52. I recommend this paper and also the one
by MacMillan et al. in the same issue (pp81-109) of that journal to readers
of this list interested in landform generation using DEMs.

I've never seen anyone adding 25% error to a contour-derived DEM.

We've thought about it, but it is more dificult than it seems.  First, as
someone pointed out, a shift of quarter of a contour interval could
drastically alter the apparent position of features in low-slope areas,
when we *know* those features are pretty fixed.  Second, we've
generally found the traditional surveying guidelines to be a conservative
description of error that doesn't match the true statistical description of
contour error, and it follows that a reconstruction solely based on this
approach is likely to be erroneous.

Having said this, we are trying a few methods to see what comes out of
allowing "fuzz" in the contours - at least to see what artifacts turn up. 
No conclusions yet.

This is turning out to be quite an interesting little topic line isn't it ?

Hi there,

This contour line discussion is great, let me add my contribution.
Sometime ago, I came across a paper written at the Technical University of
Vienna about the improvement of DEM extracted from contour lines. I
thought that was an interesting one. You can look it up at:
http://www.ipf.tuwien.ac.at/veroeffentlichungen/dh_p_isprs98/dh_p_isprs98.html

Happy Christmas to all of you, and keep talking about line issues, they
are very interesting.

Hunter & Goodchild, 1993, took the USGS standard: "90% of elevations 
values will be within 1/2 of a contour interval" to define a theoretical 
model of elevation magnitude uncertainty. That paper was fleshed out in 
Hunter & Goodchild (1995). The other two citations show models of 
representing elevation uncertainty. These four papers use statistical 
models to represent elevation magnitude uncertainty.

When Richard was asking for "fuzzy DTM", did he specifically desire a 
DTM representation that could be used in a fuzzy logic environment? The 
research I've read proposing fuzzy logic DTM models have only created 
representations of magnitude. Statistical models dovetail nicely with 
geostatistical methods allowing both magnitude and pattern 
representations of DTM.
