A small collection of things I like to have or change in my OSGeo4W environment on Windows.
Basic use guide:

1. Unpack o4w_extras.zip somehwere
2. Install latest version of OSGeo4W
3. Open 'OSGeo4W Shell' and run c:\path\to\o4w_extras\o4w-extras-install.bat

And that's it!

Other than the ease of adding these improvements to new installs, the utility I like the best is gdal-help, because I’m forever forgetting how to spell the commands.

The following components were written by others. There may be newer/better versions than what I have here.

.\bin\
	o4w-apt			- install packages from command line, based on cyg-apt by Jan Nieuwenhuizen
	gdalcopyproj.py	- copy projection without creating a new image, Schuyler Erle
